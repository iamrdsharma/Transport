					</ol>
					<h5>2. OUR SERVICES - NEUTRAL VENUE</h5>
					<p>1. We are not a transportation service provider, freight forwarder, broker or intermediary of any sort. The Site acts as a neutral venue through which Transport Providers and Users can meet and enter into negotiations with a view to entering into Transactions. We are in no way involved in the actual Transaction. We have no, and assume no, control over the quality, safety, or legal aspects of the Jobs and/or Transactions that take place through the Site.</p>
					<p>2. If you are a Transport Provider you hereby agree that the Site is for shipping/transportation related services only and that work that you provide will only involve services. Except with our prior written agreement, you agree that you will not use your Membership as a means to market or sell any goods products or other services unrelated to the Job.</p>
					<p>3. It is the responsibility of the User to select a suitable Transport Provider for the provision of the Job and the responsibility of the User and the Transport Provider to negotiate the terms of the Transaction.</p>
					<h5>3. GENERAL DISCLAIMER</h5>
					<p>1. Save where expressly stated otherwise in the Conditions, and only to the extent so stated, no provision of the Conditions shall be enforceable under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 and the Conditions do not give rise to any legal contracts, liabilities, obligations, claims or other benefits or protection between Members or in favour of third parties. Your contract in connection with a Transaction will be with the other Member and, as a result, we can give no commitments of any nature about the other Member (whether User, Transport Provider or Successful Transport Provider (as defined hereafter) or the Job, whether as to quality, quantity, delivery or price</p>
					<p>2. We assume no responsibility for claims made by Transport Providers with respect to their licenses, insurance, registration, membership or trade association or indeed any other claim made at any point during the Transaction or quoting process. We operate purely as a neutral venue through which Transport Providers and Users may agree on a price for a Job.</p>
					<h5>4. UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS</h5>
					<p>1. Members shall not use the Site for unlawful activities. Any Job or aspect of a Transaction carried out, or sought to be carried out unlawfully, by either Transport Provider or User, is prohibited.</p>
					<p>2. Certain Transactions may be governed by statutory or other regulations and cannot therefore be negotiated freely. It is for the Members to identify and adhere to such regulations.</p>
					<h5>5. TRANSPORTATION</h5>
					<p>1. The posting of Jobs for the transportation of certain items is prohibited or restricted. These include hazardous or dangerous goods. Additionally there are certain items that do not generally pose a danger to health, safety, or property while being transported but are regulated or banned for public policy reasons from being transported. Generally, Jobs for the transportation of goods that cannot be sent through Royal Mail (excluding living creatures) are not permittedto be listed on the Site. However some hazardous goods can lawfully be transported provided they are properly packaged and labelled. Such Jobs may be listed on the Site provided that the shipment listing contains a clear notice of the hazardous nature of the material and a description of the planned method of shipping that complies with the law. If you are unsure of the legality of your shipment, we recommend you contact our customer services team via the contact details at the end of these Supplemental Conditions, prior to listing the Job. A member of our team will be able to refer you to the appropriate authority to answer your question.</p>
					<p>2. Full responsibility for compliance with all laws and regulations that relate to the transportation of hazardous and restricted goods rests with the parties to the Transaction. Anyone who sends, or causes to be sent, a prohibited or restricted item or improperly packaged hazardous material may be subject to severe regulatory, or indeed criminal penalties.</p>
					<p>3. In order to assist Members we provide distance calculations and driving directions (or links to 3rd party driving directions) as part of our service (the "Directions"). However the Directions should be used as a guide only and you should always drive in accordance with national rules, regulations, and highway codes. The Directions may not take into consideration issues such as road closures, direction of traffic, one-way systems, emergency access roads, height regulations, road conditions or restrictions on manoeuvrability. No representation is made or warranty given as to the content or usability of the Directions or their appropriateness for any particular journey or vehicle. We assume no responsibility for any loss, damage, or delay howsoever resulting from use of these Directions. However, if you do find an error or omission, please let us know so we can notify the relevant persons to enable them to correct the error or omission and improve the service. We recommend that you verify any pickup and delivery information that we provide with the other party to the Transaction.</p>
					<h5>6. FEES</h5>
					<p>1. AnyMovers is free to join either as a transport provider or user and it is free to request quotes. We charge a success fee (the "Fee") to Transport Providers who have secured a Job ("Successful Transport Providers"). A Job will be considered to be secured if after quoting, messaging or contacting the User via the Site a Transport Provider is paid the Deposit (as defined hereafter).</p>
					<p>2. When you become a Member you will be allocated an account into which Deposits will be paid and from which Fees (in each case as defined hereafter) will be deducted by us in accordance with this clause 6 (the "Account")</p>
					<p>3. The Fee is based upon a tiered percentage of the Successful Transport Provider's accepted quote price. The Fee is dynamically calculated at the time of placing a quote and differs category by category. Transport Provider's may quickly and easily view the Fee amount charged on a Job by visiting their sales report.</p>
					<p>4. The incurring of the Fee is independent of the actual performance of the Job. Subject to clause 7, the obligation to pay the Fee therefore still applies if a Job is placed via the Site but is not subsequently carried out and/or the Transaction is later terminated. We may waive our right to receive the Fee as a gesture of goodwill; however the grant of any such waiver is entirely within our discretion and if so granted is always without accepting any legal obligation to do so.</p>
					<p>5. As a User, when you accept a quote, you will pay a deposit in the amount of the Fee (the "Deposit") into your Account which is immediately transferred to the Successful Transport Provider's Account from which we then debit the sum as payment of the Fee.</p>
					<p>6. If you are a Transport Provider you are responsible for collecting and remitting any and all VAT associated with a Transaction. Your quote amount for the Job is inclusive of VAT in accordance with clause 12.1.2. You shall not submit a quote amount excluding VAT and then charge VAT on top of your quote price once your quote has been accepted.</p>
					<p>7. We reserve the right to waive or change the basis for the calculation of the Fee at any time. We may also temporarily change or suspend the Fee for a promotional period. Any such changes will be described on the Site.</p>
					<h5>7. CANCELLATIONS</h5>
					<p>1. If a Job is cancelled by a Successful Transport Provider AFTER a quote was accepted but BEFORE any work on the Job commenced (a "Cancellation") the user may seek to file a "Cancellation Request" and have the Deposit returned to them either as Credit to use on future Any-Movers.com deposit payments or a  direct Refund to the funding payment method used. A cancellation request must be filed within 28 days of quote acceptance, requests made after this time will be invalid. If a cancellation request is accepted (see 7.x clauses below), the user can choose to receive either a Credit or Refund and this will be issued in the amount of the Deposit already paid.</p>
					<p>2. Credit may be used to accept future quotes on Any-Movers.com within 2 years of the <strong>"Cancellation Request"</strong> date. After a period of 2 years from the date of the <strong>"Cancellation Request"</strong>, this credit will expire and be un-usable. AnyMovers.com credit is non with-drawable / refundable and may only be used for accepting quotes on Any-Movers.com</p>
					<p>3. Refunds of Deposits will be made within 5 working days of the "Cancellation Request" being accepted. Refunds can only be sent to the same source from which the funds originated</p>
					<p>4. Users and Successful Transport Providers will negotiate directly once there has been a successful quote. Either party can make a Cancellation Request; however it should only make one once all reasonable attempts to reach an agreeable solution have been exhausted and it is clear that the Job will not be performed. You may not make a Cancellation Request until at least 7 days after the date on which the quote was originally accepted. When you make a Cancellation Request the other party to the proposed Transaction will be notified and will have 72 hours to respond by either:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>accepting the Cancellation Request and your reason; or</li>
						<li>2. rejecting the Cancellation Request and requesting review by our staff.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>5. If your Cancellation Request is accepted by the other party the accepted quote can be retracted and the Job can either be relisted or deleted. If the request is rejected by the other party, then it is sent to us for review and a decision will be made on whether to approve or not to approve the Cancellation Request. Once we have given our verdict on whether to approve the Cancellation Request we will not enter into any further correspondence - our decision is final.</p>
					<p>6. If the other party does not respond within the 72 hour grace period, your Cancellation Request and reason will automatically be accepted. Depending on the reasons for the Cancellation Request, any amounts associated with the Deposit or the Fee may be credited to your Any-Movers.com account at our sole discretion and in line with clause 7.1.</p>
					<p>7. We take abuse of the procedure for Cancellation Requests very seriously. Abuse includes submitting false or exaggerated reasons, attempting to retract accepted quotes, or colluding with other Members to abuse the procedure. If a Member is found abusing or is suspected of abusing the procedure in this clause 7 his Cancellation Request will automatically be denied and his Membership may be revoked without further notice and/or he may also be subject to additional fees</p>
					<h5>8. FEEDBACK</h5>
					<p>1. Whilst we are unable ourselves to conduct any due diligence on our Members, we do enable Users and Successful Transport Providers to provide feedback evaluations on each other's performance in the course of the Transaction including but not limited to the performance of the Job (or, as the case may be, their failure to enter into a Transaction and/or perform the Job). The evaluations seek to provide Members with guidance on the skills and/or reliability of other Members prior to quoting or, in the case of Users accepting a quote from a Transport Provider.</p>
					<p>2. The feedback process involves leaving a rating along with a short comment about the performance of the Member. There are three feedback scores that you can give: +1 (positive,) 0 (neutral), and -1 (negative). A Member's overall feedback score is the average score of the ratings that he or she has received.</p>
					<p>3. You accept that by posting a Job or by quoting on a Job it is probable that another Member will leave feedback about you and you acknowledge that your feedback consists solely of comments left by other Members and the overall feedback score calculated in accordance with clause 8.2. You agree that you will not use any feedback received on the Site on any venue or website that is not the Site. Do always use common sense and respect when leaving feedback on another Member as unwarranted, potentially libellous feedback could result in legal claims being made against you. We do not censor feedback or investigate it for accuracy, and you acknowledge that we are in no way legally responsible for any feedback that is left.</p>
					<p>4. Any use of profanity, libellous behaviour, illegal activity, or any other form of abuse of the feedback function or any other part of the Site may result in a ban from further use of the Site and, if applicable, being reported to any relevant authorities.</p>
					<h5>9. NO AGENCY</h5>
					<p>Nothing herein shall create or be deemed to create any joint venture, agency or partnership relationship between ourselves and any Members whatsoever. Members shall not hold themselves out as implying any such relationship with us.</p>
					<h5>10. ACCOUNT FLAGGING / REPORTING SYSTEM</h5>
					<p>The Site is policed by the visitors to it through a flagging system. The flagging system is used to ensure that insofar as possible the Site complies with the Conditions. Visitors are able to 'flag' aspects of the Site that do not comply with the Conditions. White flags are located in areas that can be reported. These include: messages, the quote details section, member profiles, and shipment listing information. To flag any part of the text you may click on the white flag following the text in question and the white flag will turn yellow. A yellow flag is sent to our team for review. Following the review, the team will either grant a 'green flag', meaning there was no violation, or a 'red flag', meaning there was a violation and the content has been removed. We reserve the right to suspend the Membership of any Member who has received a red flag on more than one occasion.</p>
					<h5>11. INFORMATION YOU SUPPLY</h5>
					<p>1. You are solely responsible for the information you provide to us and/or other Members in the Registration, shipping, or transportation process (which shall include anything posted on the Site) ("Information"). The Information must be true, legal, accurate, and non-fraudulent.</p>
					<p>2. Other than personally identifiable information, which is covered under our Privacy Policy (accessible by clicking on the link ) any Information shall be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. We shall have no obligations with respect to such material. We shall be free to copy, disclose, distribute, incorporate and otherwise use the Information and all data, images, sounds, text and other things embodied therein for any and all commercial or non-commercial purposes.</p>
					<p>3. You agree to use common sense and good judgment when conducting or posting any Information. We insist that all Members abide by netiquette and communicate with each other in a respectful manner.</p>
					<h5>12. FRAUD</h5>
					<h6>1. FEEDBACK</h6>
					<p>1. An important aspect of the Site is the ability of Members to leave feedback about each other (whether positive, neutral or negative). As described in clause 8, the feedback you receive is likely to influence the choices that other Members make as to whether to negotiate a Transaction with you. Accordingly, to preserve the integrity of the feedback system, you agree not to:</p>
					<p>2. improperly influence in any manner, or cause another to improperly influence in any manner, the feedback of a Member; or</p>
					<p>3. post or attempt to post, in any manner or by any means, a feedback review on your own account.</p>
